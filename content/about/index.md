As a full stack web developer with an eclectic background in IT and audio/video engineering, I bring a unique perspective to my work. My journey in software development has led me to [Defendify](https://defendify.com), where I work alongside a highly skilled team, contributing to various software projects and playing a key role in enhancing and maintaining our diverse range of web applications.

Beyond coding, I'm actively involved in the aviation community. Since September 2023, I have been volunteering as a member of the board of directors for the [Franconia Soaring Foundation (FSF)](https://soarfranconia.org). As the chairman of the communications committee, one of my key projects was revamping the FSF website, enhancing our digital presence and outreach.
