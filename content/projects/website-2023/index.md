## My Choice to Downgrade

_Let me explain..._ Typically, "downgrading" has negative connotations attached. If someone said to you they were downgrading their website, you might think they are crazy, right?

Well in this case, it's quite the opposite. So don't sweat it, Jim and Pam's of the world. I have made the decision to **downgrade complexity** and **embrace simplicity** for the next iteration of my website.

To accomplish this, I moved from Next JS to Hugo. Next is a powerful and versatile framework and always felt like using a nailgun when a hammer would suffice for the majority of projects I used it for.

Becoming more familiar with the land of web/software development, I eventually came to the conclusion that simplicity goes a long way. problems are simple until they become complex, so it's best to maximize the time you have in the former. Next _can_ be used simply, but for most projects the result ends in more overhead than might be necessary. "So how can I combat that?", I asked myself.

My answer to that is, for the majority of projects, a classic multi-page app (MPA) will do the trick. Comparing before and after, Next and Hugo are both frameworks in their own unique ways. Next and Hugo builds result in static content, so pages are fast and SEO-optimized right out of the box. The big difference here being the overhead that comes with a JavaScript framework like Next.
